## Installation 
To install this application you must first clone the repo to your local machine. Once the repo is cloned to your machine, you must then install the dependencies jest and inquirer in your root directy after an NPM install. Once mysql2 and inquirer have been installed you must create a .env file and input the DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD fields to match what's in the connection.js file. You will also have to put your mysql password into the password value in the connection.js file. Once that is done you can login to the mysql shell and source all three sql files in the db/ folder. Once those files have been sourced using the 'source db/...' command then your last step is to launch the command line application using 'node index' as a command.
